## About this project

This is a simple single-page app developed with React. The app contains a small signup form and a list of participants.

### Features

- The list contains 20 random participants. Names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers are fetched from an API, and IDs are generated with a library.
- The user can add a new participant via the signup form. Only participants with a valid name, e-mail address and phone number are added.
- The user can edit any row by clicking on an icon.
- The user can delete any row by clicking on an icon.
- The user can sort the list by clicking on any column header.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### The developer

I developed this app because I wanted to become a better React developer, and to prove [I have at least the basic skills in React](https://github.com/digiaonline/docs/tree/master/recruitment/html5).

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine.
2. Download this app from GitHub.
3. On command line go to the project directory.
4. Run the app: `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
